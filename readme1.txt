Hey,Everyone ! Today we are going to check out an awesome project on facial Recognition using OpenCV and KNN (Classification algo. in Machine Learning). This project Takes your photo as data input where captured image is converted to a numpy array (3d-matrix) and is fed to the algo.. The Algo. forms various clusters based on photos of various people and when a test image is served, the algo. output the name of file that contains most compareable (similar) photos as of test image.
The project has 2 codes (to be run in Terminal of python {preferabley 3.7})
1. Code 1 takes training data, You need to input the name of person and aroung 50 photos of the respective person. You can add as many data points{ diffrent person photos} as you want.
2. Code 2 takes test image from a live video recording. Multiple faces can be detected and name of respective{most similar} person is output.

Requirments:
1. Python 3.5 or above
2. install following Libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Pandas, Opencv{ check readme3 for more info}
3. Jupyter notebook {with python and pip}
4. Internal Camera with Laptop 
5. Proper Specs and OS for Laptop including alteast 2gb RAM, preferably a dedicated GPU etc.
